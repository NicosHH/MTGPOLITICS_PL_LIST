Building a Power Level Indication List for Magic: The Gathering, especially in the Commander format, is a nuanced task due to the vast card pool and the diversity of strategies available. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you measure the power level of a deck:

1. Define Power Level Categories
Start by defining clear categories for power levels. A common approach is a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 represents a casual, theme-based deck and 10 represents a competitive, optimized deck with the best available cards.

2. Establish Criteria
Develop a set of criteria for each category. These criteria can include:

Win Condition Speed: How quickly can the deck reliably win? Competitive decks often aim to win by turn 3-5, while more casual decks may not focus on winning before turn 10.

Consistency: How consistently does the deck perform its strategy? This can be measured by the redundancy of effects and the quality of the mana base.

Interaction: How capable is the deck at interacting with opponents? This includes counterspells, removal, and other instant-speed responses.

Resilience: How well can the deck recover from board wipes or targeted disruption?

Card Quality and Synergy: How powerful are the individual cards, and how well do they work together?

Combo Potential: Does the deck have infinite combos or game-ending synergies that can win out of nowhere?

3. Analyze Decklists
Collect a variety of decklists that represent different power levels. Analyze and categorize them based on your established criteria.

4. Benchmarking
Identify benchmark decks for each power level. These decks should be well-known within the community and represent the typical characteristics of their respective category.

5. Score Individual Aspects
Create a scoring system for each of the criteria. For example, assign a score from 1 to 10 for consistency, interaction, and other factors. Then, average these scores to get an overall power level.

6. Peer Review
Have the list reviewed by other experienced players. Peer reviews can help ensure that the list is objective and takes into account different playstyles and metagames.

7. Playtesting
Playtest decks against each other to see if they perform as expected within their power level. Adjust the list based on the outcomes.

8. Regular Updates
Keep the list updated. As new sets are released and the metagame shifts, decks can rise or fall in power level.

9. Community Feedback
Engage with the Magic: The Gathering community to get feedback on your power level list. This can provide insights that you might have missed and help refine the list further.

10. Documentation
Create a clear and detailed document or database that outlines the power level of various decks, including examples and the reasoning behind their categorization.

11. User-Friendly Interface
Since you're interested in AI and automation, consider creating a tool where players can input their decklist and receive a tentative power level assessment based on your criteria. This could involve natural language processing to interpret the decklist and machine learning to compare it against your benchmark decks.

By following these steps, you can create a useful Power Level Indication List that will help players gauge the strength of their Commander decks and make informed decisions about how to adjust their decks for different playgroups and environments.
