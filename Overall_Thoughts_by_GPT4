Building a Power Level Indication List for Magic: The Gathering, especially in the Commander format, is a nuanced task due to the vast card pool and the diversity of strategies available. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you measure the power level of a deck:

1. Define Power Level Categories
Start by defining clear categories for power levels. A common approach is a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 represents a casual, theme-based deck and 10 represents a competitive, optimized deck with the best available cards.

2. Establish Criteria
Develop a set of criteria for each category. These criteria can include:

Win Condition Speed: How quickly can the deck reliably win? Competitive decks often aim to win by turn 3-5, while more casual decks may not focus on winning before turn 10.

Consistency: How consistently does the deck perform its strategy? This can be measured by the redundancy of effects and the quality of the mana base.

Interaction: How capable is the deck at interacting with opponents? This includes counterspells, removal, and other instant-speed responses.

Resilience: How well can the deck recover from board wipes or targeted disruption?

Card Quality and Synergy: How powerful are the individual cards, and how well do they work together?

Combo Potential: Does the deck have infinite combos or game-ending synergies that can win out of nowhere?

3. Analyze Decklists
Collect a variety of decklists that represent different power levels. Analyze and categorize them based on your established criteria.

4. Benchmarking
Identify benchmark decks for each power level. These decks should be well-known within the community and represent the typical characteristics of their respective category.

5. Score Individual Aspects
Create a scoring system for each of the criteria. For example, assign a score from 1 to 10 for consistency, interaction, and other factors. Then, average these scores to get an overall power level.

6. Peer Review
Have the list reviewed by other experienced players. Peer reviews can help ensure that the list is objective and takes into account different playstyles and metagames.

7. Playtesting
Playtest decks against each other to see if they perform as expected within their power level. Adjust the list based on the outcomes.

8. Regular Updates
Keep the list updated. As new sets are released and the metagame shifts, decks can rise or fall in power level.

9. Community Feedback
Engage with the Magic: The Gathering community to get feedback on your power level list. This can provide insights that you might have missed and help refine the list further.

10. Documentation
Create a clear and detailed document or database that outlines the power level of various decks, including examples and the reasoning behind their categorization.

11. User-Friendly Interface
Since you're interested in AI and automation, consider creating a tool where players can input their decklist and receive a tentative power level assessment based on your criteria. This could involve natural language processing to interpret the decklist and machine learning to compare it against your benchmark decks.

By following these steps, you can create a useful Power Level Indication List that will help players gauge the strength of their Commander decks and make informed decisions about how to adjust their decks for different playgroups and environments.

To refine the power level assessment of a Commander deck in Magic: The Gathering, it's essential to consider a variety of factors that contribute to the deck's performance and consistency. Your existing categories are a solid foundation, covering most of the critical aspects of a deck's capabilities. However, to deepen your power level indication list, you can include metrics for measuring each category's impact and how they interplay with each other.

From the resources I've examined, here are some additional insights and refinements you could consider integrating into your power level assessment:

Card Advantage: Evaluate the quality and quantity of draw spells, their cost, and how they synergize with the deck's strategy. A deck's ability to maintain card advantage can be pivotal in assessing its power​1​​2​.

Commander: The choice of commander can significantly influence a deck's power level. Consider the commander's impact, abilities, and how it dictates the deck's playstyle​3​.

Gameplan: Understanding a deck's gameplan involves more than just knowing the strategy. It's about how quickly and efficiently it can execute its plan and adapt to the opponents' strategies​4​.

Interaction: Interaction isn't just about having responses but also about when and how to use them effectively. The deck's capability to disrupt opponents' plans can indicate a higher power level​5​​6​.

Manabase: A strong manabase is crucial for consistency. Evaluate not just the lands but also how the deck can handle color fixing and mana curve optimization​7​.

Ramp: Consider the ramp's speed, efficiency, and how it aligns with the deck's curve. Fast and efficient ramp can drastically improve a deck's power level​8​.

Refinement: Refinement is about tuning the deck to its peak performance. This includes optimizing card choices, reducing redundancy, and enhancing synergy​9​.

Resilience: Assess a deck's ability to recover from setbacks, such as board wipes or targeted removal. Resilience can be a significant indicator of power level​10​.

Synergies: Beyond individual card strength, evaluate how cards work together to create powerful interactions or combos within the deck​11​.

Wincon: The type and variety of win conditions can define a deck's power level. Consider the deck's ability to consistently reach and execute its win conditions​12​.

In addition to these categories, consider integrating a metric called "Resolutions Or Attacks Required" (ROAR). This metric measures a deck’s explosiveness — how fast it can win from nothing — rather than just its speed. It evaluates the average number of unhindered spells or attack steps needed to win and can be a more reliable indicator of power than just the turn count​13​.

Also, be aware that the power level might not be the same across all metagames. Local playgroups can have different norms and expectations, which can shift the perception of a deck's power level. It’s essential to adapt the power level indication list to the specific environment in which it will be used​13​.

Lastly, it’s important to note that the power level is not an exact science and will vary from group to group. Some decks might perform better or worse depending on the player's skill and the specific metagame they are in​13​.

By incorporating these insights into your power level assessment, you can develop a more nuanced and accurate tool for evaluating Commander decks.


--------------------------------------------

Creating a weighted scale for each category in a Commander deck's power level assessment involves assigning significance to each aspect based on its impact on the game. Here's a suggestion on how you could form a 1-10 scale for each category, with 1 being the least impactful or refined and 10 representing the highest level of impact or refinement:

Card_Advantage:

1: No card draw or only very high-cost card draw spells.
5: Some card draw spells, but they are conditional or costly.
10: Numerous efficient card draw spells and engines, ensuring a consistent flow of cards.
Commander:

1: Commander has little synergy with the rest of the deck or is rarely used.
5: Commander synergizes with some elements of the deck but is not a key part of the strategy.
10: Commander is integral to the deck’s strategy and can consistently turn games in your favor.
Gameplan:

1: No clear game plan or strategy, winning is more coincidental.
5: A defined strategy exists but lacks consistency or is easily disrupted.
10: A clear, resilient strategy that can adapt to different opponents and is executed consistently.
Interaction:

1: Minimal interaction with opponents, with few or no removal or counter spells.
